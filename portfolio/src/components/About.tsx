        About Me
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-2xl leading-relaxed">
        I’m a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with over 3 years of consulting experience at Deloitte Consulting. There I led application modernization initiatives using React.js/TypeScript and Java Spring Boot—designing high-performance RESTful APIs that supported over 500,000 concurrent users, and delivered seamless data interaction at scale.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-2xl leading-relaxed">
        I’m currently pursuing my Master of Science in Data Science at Monash University (Jul 2023–Jun 2025), where I’ve completed core coursework in Big Data Analytics, Statistical Modelling, and Machine Learning. I’ve built interactive R Shiny and D3.js dashboards, engineered Spark pipelines to process 10M+ records, and applied ARIMA time-series forecasting and clustering methods to real-world datasets.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-2xl leading-relaxed">
        In addition, I’ve architected and deployed Dockerized Python microservices and analytics workflows on Azure, improving system performance by 30%, boosting data accessibility by 40%, and reducing downtime by 25%. My hands-on expertise spans NLP-driven chatbots, predictive modeling, and interactive Power BI and Tableau dashboards that translate raw data into actionable insights.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base md:text-2xl leading-relaxed">
        Outside of work and study, I play division-level soccer in Melbourne and actively contribute to open-source analytics projects—continuously sharpening my skills at the intersection of data innovation and real-world impact.
